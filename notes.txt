Notes for different languages:

Primary applications (Via Google) -

*Ruby (Mac, Windows, Unix, and most operating systems.) - 'web scraping, static site generation, command-line tools, automation, DevOps, and data processing.'

*C# (Windows, .NET) - 'C# is often used to develop professional, dynamic websites on the . NET platform, or open-source software. So, even if you're not a fan of the Microsoft architecture, you can still use C# to create a fully-functional website.'

*JavaScript (Web) - '...' allows you to make web pages interactive. '...'

*Go - 'The main design goal of Go is to facilitate fast compilation, unlike some of the other common languages. When compared to C++, Go reduces the amount of runtime errors and dependencies while increasing memory safety and memory management.'

*Python (desktop, data) - '...' 'build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis' '...'

*Rust - 'Rust is a statically-typed programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency and memory management. Its syntax is similar to that of C++. It is an open-source project developed originally at Mozilla Research.;

*Swift (Mobie - Ios/Mac) - 'Swift is a robust and intuitive programming language created by Apple for building apps for iOS, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. It's designed to give developers more freedom than ever. Swift is easy to use and open source, so anyone with an idea can create something incredible.'

hopeful layout -

Would you prefer to work on projects for Mobile, Desktop or Web based platforms?
mobile = swift 
desktop = python
web = JavaScript

would you rather work with big data, games or app development?
data = python
games = JavaScript
app = swift

where would you like to work from?
Anywhere I want = python
headquarters = swift
home = JavaScript

what makes you want to learn?
Change of career = JavaScript
challenge myselft = python
I wanna make it big! = swift

goal is to combine and find most common answer and provide that.

would you rather...
Fight a bear in a bare bones boxing bananza??
Stub your toe on every door jamb and stair you step on/through?
 result for both = 'Huh.. Interesting...'
